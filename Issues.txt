 - Binary operations do not pretty-print parentheses
 - Comments don't work in either Java or Python
 - Python does not like empty lines in files -- parse errors
 - Python allows for `x, y, z = True`
   -  Also need to allow for assignments like `x += 3`
   -  New ADT for assignments specifically?
 - Still need to do some type-checking for Java, just no reconstruction, right?
 - Won't implementing functions be far easier than anticipated? 
   - "Implementing" functions is just parsing them and pretty-printing them 
   - Will almost certainly cause some issues with types, but that will be the only issues I can see
 - Java terminators ';' and '}'
   -  Parsing a stmt as either a single line or a block, but does that cause issues with functions, as they require {}?
 - Python detecting tab/columns

"Static-Type Checking:
   - Verify safety of program before execution.
Dynamic Type Checking: 
   - Verify safety of program at execution."
