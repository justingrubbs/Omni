 - Python strings have '+' and '*' as valid binary operators
   - '+' is concatenation
   - '*' is duplication; the second argument must be an integer
      -- https://realpython.com/python-strings/
 - Binary operations do not pretty-print parentheses
 - Python allows for `x,y,z = True,3,"Yup"` and `x = y = z = True`
   -  Also need to allow for assignments like `x += 3`
   -  New ADT for assignments specifically?
 - Still need to do some type-checking for Java, just no reconstruction, right?
   - I don't think so?

 - The entirety of quirks.py 
 - Inference required on statements as well 
 - Constraint-solving and unification need to be implemented in some capacity 
 - Lot of clean-up necessary before it's a decent project
 - Modularize the REPL translate function better
 - Main function band-aid fix needs to be made more secure

   - Verify safety of program before execution.
Dynamic Type Checking: 
   - Verify safety of program at execution."
