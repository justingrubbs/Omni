 - Binary operations do not pretty-print parentheses
 - Recursion broken
 - Functions barely implemented, much work needed
 - Weird issue with an assignment in conditional in test1.py
 - Probably a significant amount of behaviors are currently possible but should be errored out
 - Transpiling to Java from a directory is ugly but works-ish
