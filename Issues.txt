 - Binary operations do not pretty-print parentheses
 - Python allows for `x, y, z = True` (so does Java?)
   -  Also need to allow for assignments like `x += 3`
   -  New ADT for assignments specifically?
 - Still need to do some type-checking for Java, just no reconstruction, right?
 - Won't implementing functions be far easier than anticipated? 
   - "Implementing" functions is just parsing them and pretty-printing them 
   - Will almost certainly cause some issues with types, but that will be the only issues I can see
 - Java AST transforming has issues with syntax like `int x,y,z = 20;`

   - Verify safety of program before execution.
Dynamic Type Checking: 
   - Verify safety of program at execution."
